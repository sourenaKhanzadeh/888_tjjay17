Tests have been organized in a subfolder in the following format:
--Tests
  --Function
    -- test_name_0
      --test_name_0.inp
        --test_name_0.out
    -- test_name_1
      --test_name_1.inp
        --test_name_1.out-- 

"Function" is the subfolder that contains all the tests that
pertain to a certain feature. Examples of "Function" are Buy & Sell.
"test_name" is a descriptive name for each individual test, and is 
appended with a "0" for a positive test case, & a "1" for a negative
test case. 

Files with a .inp extension indicate the command-line inputs
applied for the test case while files with a .out extension 
relay the output expected from the program once the input specified
in the .inp file is fed to the command-line program.

A DOS batch script will be used to run each of the tests in the 'Test' directory - with each test 
being executed by the script. The script will run the command-line 
program for each of the specified inputs and then compare the output
that is obtained from the command-line program execution to the output
that is recorded in the .out file for each matching test. 

If the outputs of the .out file and the command-line program execution do not match,
then the batch script will immediately output the name of the test case that failed,
as well as the output that was obtained from the execution of the program. This will result
in revisitation of the specifications and code upon which the test case is created.

If the outputs of the .out file and the command-line program execution do indeed match,
then the batch script will not signify anything immediately upon completion of running a
specific test case. Instead, if all test cases pass at the end, then the script will indicate
that all tests passed with the message "All test cases have passed".
