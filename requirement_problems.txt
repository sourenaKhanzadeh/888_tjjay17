The requirements do not specify anything about negative numbers. We assumed negative numbers are not allowed to be used.
The requirements do not specify anything about the format of the username. We assumed that symbols and blank spaces are included.
The requirements do not mention anything about a password, but we assume that there is a password for logins. However, there aren't
any standardizations for password requirements.
